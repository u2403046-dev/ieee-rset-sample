# IEEE Student Branch Static Website

This is a simple HTML/CSS/JavaScript template that mimics the structure and
appearance of the IEEE RSET Student Branch site. It is intended as a starting
point; you can replace text, images, and links with your own content.

## Structure

- `index.html`: Main page containing all sections (hero, about, membership,
  societies, achievements, newsletters, gallery, mentors, contact, footer).
- `assets/css/style.css`: Basic layout and responsive styles.
- `assets/js/main.js`: Small script for mobile nav toggle and contact form stub.
- `assets/images`: Place your photos and logos here.

## Customization

1. Replace placeholder texts with your branch's information.
2. Update images in `assets/images` and change the `<img>` `src` attributes in
   `index.html` accordingly.
3. Tweak styling in `style.css` or add additional styles.
4. Enhance JavaScript functionality as needed (e.g. actual form submission,
   image galleries).

## Deployment

Because it is a static site, you can host this on GitHub Pages, Netlify, or any
static-file web server. Simply upload the contents of the `website` folder.

Feel free to extend this skeleton into multiple pages or convert it to a
framework (React, Next.js, Hugo) later if needed.
